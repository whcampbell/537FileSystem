Idempotency - wait using select()



Will - Server System Image write:

Started with port number to listen on
	Port protocols?
	local host <num>?
	look up

Create system image if does not exist
	server can target diff sys images
	serialized (duh)

Log structured FS
	checkpoint region at beginning
		addrs of inode map pieces
		disk pointer to end of log (incrementing)
	ever growing log after
		data block
		inode
			size field
			type field
			array of direct pointers
		piece of map
			indexed list of inodes
inode breakdown
4096 possible inodes - 12 bit address
maps have 16 entries - 256 map pieces - 8 bits of address
remaining four bits are index of entry

0000         |00000000
inode index  |map index (in checkpoint section);

		directory
			identified by an inode
			entries are 32 bytes
				4096 / 32 bytes = 128 total entries
				4 bytes for inode
				28 for name
				allocated on creation, set to -1
			first two entries are . and ..
				. is a name, inode number is self inode number
				.. is name for parent, has parent inode number 


Idempotency - empty buffers via fsync() 
	in case of crash
		not really certain what this does

Communication
	Finish all operations before going to UDP read
		prevents shutdown before sending back reply
